<p><span class="firstcharacter">H</span></p>aving just moved homes in between term time I find myself unable to carry out any work. As a result I thought it would be a fruitful use of my time to settle something that has bugged me for a while.

As the title of this post states, _The Plural of Arduino is Arduini_ and I will fight anyone who says differently.

This actually stems from a couple of forum posts I saw and conversations I've had with italians and non-italians over the years.

Don't get me wrong, I will happily accept _Arduinos_ as perfectly find plural of Arduino. If you came to me with handful of Arduino Uno, Nano and Arudino clones and said:

"I have some Arduinos / Arduini"

My response would not be confusion at the usage of one of the other bu rather: 

"yes, yes you do"

I am not a monster after all.


Before I state my completely infallible case, lets take a look at some previous discussion so that we have a good overview of the main talking points. 

## The Discussion So Far

Drawing from these posts:

- [Which is the plural word for Arduino: Arduini or Arduinos?](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/which-is-the-plural-word-for-arduino-arduini-or-arduinos/186746) [2013]
- [Plural of Arduino?](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/plural-of-arduino/277104) [2014]


From which we get these hypotheses: 

- >It would only be Arduini if the singular was Arduinus.

- >because Arduino is born in italy, it should follow Italian's syntatic rules... so it remains Arduino if you tink[sic] about the name as like a personal name (note the capital letter), arduini if you use as object name.


In sum the options would be:

- Arduino, as its a proper name. 
- Arduinos, as Arduini would only work if it were spelled Arduinus
- Arduinoes, like potatoes


## The case for arduini

It is clear in an english context either [Arduinos](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3943841M/The_Cambridge_grammar_of_the_English_language) or [Arduinoes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z4r8qnb#:~:text=Just%20add%20an%20'es',box%20becomes%20boxes) is fine. 

>It would only be Arduini if the singular was Arduinus.

This partially incorrect as it is not the only situation where Arduini would be applicable. [Latin plurals](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/tricky-plural-words-explained#:~:text=Syllabuses%20%26%20Syllabi&text=Both%20forms%20of%20the%20plural,you%20if%20you%20use%20syllabi.) do swap `-us` for `-i`, but singular [masculine italian nouns](https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/italian/tutors/grammar/language_notes/sing_pl.shtml) swap their `-o` (and sometimes `-e`) endings for an `-i`.

When it comes to speaking in italian, it is clear the _only_ correct answer is Arduin***i***.

>because Arduino is born in italy, it should follow Italian's syntatic rules... so it remains Arduino if you tink[sic] about the name as like a personal name (note the capital letter), arduini if you use as object name.


Lets chunk this to make it easier to digest:

>because Arduino is born in italy, it should follow Italian's syntatic rules. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus), (https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Copernico)


Yes, it _should_, but italians don't do this themselves. Just ask Niccolo Copernicus [[en]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus)/[[it]](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Copernico) or, as a more recent example, King Charles III [[en]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III)/[[it]](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_III_del_Regno_Unito). So I don't think it _necessary_ to extend the italian naming rules to english, but it does mean Arduini _would also_ be an acceptable plural of Arduino.

>so it remains Arduino if you tink[sic] about the name as like a personal name (note the capital letter), arduini if you use as object name.

I have variations on this from actual italians as well, but here is where I take some umbrage. If _neither_ Arduinos, or Arduini is correct, that argument here is that we have a fish / sheep situation where one would have to say:

"I have one Arduino Uno and an Arduino Nano, I have two Arduino"

Now, this just sounds a bit odd. It doesn't even roll off of the tongue particularly nicely. There are a few reasons why this is just incorrect and why Arduini _just is_.

### Point 1: an Arduino _is_ an object

>arduini if you use as object name.

I think at this point the word Arduino is being thrown around not just to describe the _company_ Arduino, but also 

_any microcontroller board who's programming is easily integrated within the Arduino infrastructure_. 

You can say: 

- an [Adafruit MCU](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/arduino-microcontrollers?vendor=Adafruit) is an arduino
- a [Teensy](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/arduino-microcontrollers?product_type=Teensy) is an arduino
- an [Espruino](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/arduino-microcontrollers?vendor=Espruino) is an arduino

and any sane person would understand what you are talking about. 

Pimoroni's own subsection for _Arduino & Microcontrollers_ is simply titled "Arduino". I think we can all agree on a definition of:

>#### Arduino
>
>1. _Proper Noun_ 
>  - an Italian open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. [_[thanks wikipedia]_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)
>2. _Noun_ (colloquial)
>  - any single-board microcontrollers who's programming is easily integrated within the Arduino company development infrastructure.
   

### Point 2: Paparazzo

>so it remains Arduino if you tink[sic] about the name as like a personal name (note the capital letter)



I want you to meet this guy.

| :-----------------------: |
|       Exhibit **A**       |

His name, his _personal name_, is Paparazzo, a character in Federico Fellini's _La Dolce Vita_, and if you already know where I am going with this then thank you for conceding defeat.

Paparazzo is interesting as his name co-opted for the profession of morally questionable freelance photography. Since these photographers come in herds you are likely familiar with it plural in english, [paparazzi](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-34353559).

- If Paparazzo is a proper noun
- that is used for another purpose
- whose plural follows standard Italian grammar

then it can be concluded that you cannot have paparazzi and _not_ have arduini. As discussed above, arduino _also_ means "single-board microcontrollers" but even if you squeeze that down to just "single-board microcontrollers made by the Arduino company" then they are _still_ objects.
