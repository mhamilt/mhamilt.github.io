I am a <s>second</s> third rate musician and someone who enjoys programming in any language. I am currently undertaking a PhD and as result updates are sparse. I worked at Edinburgh College of Art where I caught the bug for trying to help artists be dangerous programming projects, not dangerous with electronics and generally how to have and be silly with computers.

Anyone can program and has the right to learn programming and in the end it is mainly just workflow. I hope to demonstrate that in this blog.
